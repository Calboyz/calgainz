Developer Notes:
The most challenging part was creating the Meteor project from scratch because we usually had a template to follow for the file structure. For this project, we had to follow the best Meteor practice for file structure. Another challenge that we ran into was pulling the data from MongoDB and displaying it on the page with no errors. We had to wait for the data to be loaded onto the page before rendering any of the React components. We are proud of the calorie tracking and leaderboard system because they work properly and smoothly with no bugs that we could find. Unfortunately, we were not able to develop more features like the tips/forum feature due to time constraints. For a disclaimer, the user profile page displays a random photo and not the photo that a user can set.
